Privacy Policy

The apps developed by Lancimator (“we”, “us”, or “our”) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

1. Information We Collect

a) Personal Information We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information to use the core features of the app.

b) Usage Data We may collect limited, non-personal usage data (such as app open counts, achievement unlocks, and anonymous error reports) to help us improve the app and its stability. This data does not contain information that identifies you personally.

c) In-App Purchases If you choose to support us with a voluntary payment, purchases are processed securely through Google Play. We do not have access to your payment information. Google Play may collect information as described in their own privacy policy.

d) Reviews and Feedback If you choose to leave a review or contact us via email, we may receive your email address and any information you provide voluntarily.

e) Advertising Data (AdMob) Our App uses Google AdMob, a third-party advertising service, to display advertisements. To support our App, AdMob may collect and use data about you to provide these ads. This information may include:

Device Identifiers: Such as the Google Advertising ID (GAID).

Location Data: Your IP address may be used to estimate your general location.

Technical Information: Device model, operating system, and network information.

Ad Interaction Data: Information about your interaction with ads shown in the App (e.g., clicks, impressions).

This data is used by our partner (Google) to serve personalized or non-personalized ads, to measure ad performance, and to prevent fraud.

2. How We Use Your Information

To provide, maintain, and improve the App’s features.

To process in-app purchases securely via Google Play.

To respond to your questions, feedback, or support requests.

To analyze anonymized usage data to make the app better.

To display advertisements, which helps to fund the App's development and keep it free.

3. Sharing Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with third parties only in the following ways:

Google Play: As described in Section 1(c), for processing in-app purchases.

Google AdMob (Advertising Partner): We do not manually share your personal information with Google. However, by using AdMob, we allow Google to collect data as described in Section 1(e) and in accordance with their own privacy policies. We do not share any data you send us directly (like a feedback email) with our advertising partners.

4. Third-Party Services and Your Choices

The path may vary slightly depending on your device and Android version.

5. Data Security

We use industry-standard methods to protect your data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we take reasonable steps to safeguard your information. Data collected by Google AdMob is secured by Google as described in their policies.
